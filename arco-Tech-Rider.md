_These specifications are adaptable to different performance spaces, so please be in touch with what is or isn't possible and we'll find a solution!_
  
1. Venue provides a stereo speaker configuration for tape playback (more channels are possible, let the composer know ahead of time how many and the configuration).
2. If possible/necessary venue provides a microphone for amplification and blending of acoustic performer with electronic sound. In most halls, amplification of the performer will be beneficial. This microphone should be a condenser microphone, ideally a DPA 4099, DPA 4060, or similar.
3. The performer uses a click track to keep in time with the tape part. Venue provides a female 1/8 inch headphone jack at the performance position for performer to plug earbud(s) into. Venue also provides backup earbuds in case performer requires them.
4. Venue provides playback of click track to audio outputs separate from tape part (so the audience doesn't hear the click track). The tape part and click track audio files are synchronized so that starting them both at the same time will ensure proper synchronization. Synchronization should occur in a digital audio workstation using multiple tracks. Do not attempt to synchronize by ``pushing the buttons at the same time.'' If you require the files organized differently, please get in touch.
5. If including the video designs (this will only be the case if explicitly indicated): Venue provides a projector (as large as possible) thrown onto a wall (preferably a blank white wall with the performer positioned to stand in front of the wall so some of the projection is thrown onto them). A large video screen will also work.

## Tape & Instrument Balance

The violin should never get covered up by the tape part, however, they should be about the same loudness, both feeling full and present in the space. For many performance spaces, this probably means amplifying the violin to match level and blend. For each performance setting, feel free to EQ and/or automate the volume of the tape part to comfortably blend with the violin sound. If someone is available to ride the fader during the performance, this is always appreciated! (If you find that certain sections need to be drastically adjusted, let me know, perhaps those changes should be made in the distributed performance materials!)
